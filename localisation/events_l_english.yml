 tsb_italy.1.t:0 "The Italian Empire in 1954"
 tsb_italy.1.d:0 "  Following the victory in the Second Great War, Italy found itself much closer to realizing the Roman dream than ever before. From 1936-38 Italy had conquered Ethiopia and seized Malta, Cyprus, Gibraltar and British Palestine with little resistence. Due to distractions closer to home, Britain was not able to stop the power hungry Italians from marching through their colonies and proclaiming them theirs. Italy had originally planned to annex Egypt into their Empire, but Mussolini gave them a chance at independence with heavy economic dependence on the Italians. By the time the Second Great War came around, Italy was fully prepared to face the French army and navy. In summer of 1940, Italy had officially declared war upon France, quickly taking their Alergian and Syrian colonies. Back on the main front, Italy found itself stuck in the Alps, unable to advance. Soon after though, Goering's Blitz from the north brought France to an end and Italy was granted hegemony over the Balkans as well as Nice, Corsica and the land surround the city of Annecy.\n\n  When the war with the Soviets ended in 1946, normality returned to Italy. Mussolini's economic and social policies proved to be a success in creating a new generation of workers and soldiers. Many mothers were given welfare to cover the expenses of having children. This was to combat the coming population decline that most economic advisors had been predicting. For the common worker, workdays were shortened and safety regulations were imposed in factories and other labor-intesive jobs. Recently though, many laborers are still unhappy with their conditions and have asked for more pay. Some would even join underground socialist organizations to try and create what they think to be a better society for the common man.\n\n  As the nation entered the 1950's, Italy has been trying to keep with Germany technologically with a nuclear program in the works and a rocket progrom only being a concept at this point. The matter of Duce Mussolini's health is a serious one, his health has been rapidly declining since the turn of teh decade. This has resulted in in 5 hospitalizations since 1950. His health continues to decline with no true heir decided. Many of his doctors report that he may only have 2-3 years of life left. This leaves Italy in peculiar spot and its future uncertain. Only time will tell what the future holds for dear Italy."

 tsb_italy.2.d:0 "  This morning, our beloved Duce visited the ancient city of Athens. Accompanied by Greek prime minister Konstantino Logothetopoulos, he visted sights such as the Parthenon, the Temple of Hephaestus and the statue of Hermes. The trip was recorded and broadcasted for people to tune it at home. He is quoted as saying, \"I stand here today atop the Acropolis as a son of Greece and Rome. I stand here because our roots are right here in this soil, and as the sons and daughters of the Hellenic warriors, we shall never forget that fact.\""

 tsb_germany.1.t:0 "Breaking the Ice"
 tsb_germany.1.d:0 "   The year is 1958, we stand victorious, although it did come at a cost of blood, resources and the land we conquered was nothing but rubble and ash once our world class army rolled over our enemies. The great war for the very soul of the Reich and the dreams which our great Führer Adolf Hitler set up are now fulfilled. \n\nNow the Führer can rest in peace knowing that Germany is the rightful hegemon in Europe and soon to be the World. The Reich is slowly working its way to prosperity, we dream for the day of when "Lebensraum" is completed and the day the Untermenschen are wiped off the face of the earth and Germanisation has been achieved in the east. Reconstruction although costly is being completed through the sheer will and strength of the Aryan Race. The Eagle stands with its head tall in the sky as all may seem well. \n\nBut not all is well though. Dark clouds approach the Reich as the British look jealously at our achievements and lick their wounds in preparation for the most heinous crime of fratricide against their German brothers. A defeated Russia stands in the east like a rabid dog with its ultimate goal to wipe us from earth and America though unstable as it is could become a threat to the Reich's continuation. Only time will tell what is in store for Hitler's dream of a 1000 year Reich but the eagle must always keep it's head high."

 tsb_germany.5.t:0 "Life Runs Out"
 tsb_germany.5.d:0 "All was going as planned for the ball, the aristocracy of the Reich had met for one night of modest partying and gathering. At 11 p.m., tragedy struck. A servant in the ballroom, one Till Lorenz noticed that the Führer had taken an abnormally long time in the bathroom, staying for almost an hour. He walked into the room and called the Führer's name several times. After not receiving a response from Göring, he knocked on the door of the stall he was in, notcing that it was unlocked and it slid right open. This revealed the Führer's corpse, staring up at the ceiling with dead eyes, clutching several containers of pervitin."
 tsb_germany.5.a:0 "Quick try to revive him!"

 tsb_ger_successors.1.t:0 "Tragedy in Zurich!"
 tsb_ger_successors.1.d:0 "  Lorenz checked his breath and his pulse, and found nothing. He immediately notified the ball security and officials at the ball. \n\n   An ambulance arrived at around 11:30 p.m. and took him to the nearby hospital Universitätsklinik Balgrist. There he was pronounced dead at 12:03 a.m. of sudden heart failure. The state funeral for Führer Göring is set to take place in around a week. \n\n   No one is for certain what this will mean for the future of the Reich but 6 men know what they will be doing. Alfred Rosenberg, Martin Bormann, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, Rudolph Hess and Albert Speer all have plans on becoming Führer. How they plan on achieving this is unknown to anyone other than their circles of supporters. The Reich hangs by a thread and its next leader shall attempt to create their perfect Reich."
