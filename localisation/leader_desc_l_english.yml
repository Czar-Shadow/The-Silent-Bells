He was struck with his mother's death shortly after his birth and his father remarried. He never knew that his real mother had died until age twelve, after his father's death. He was hit with massive family debt but was helped out by the Sumitomo Group, a prominent Zaibatsu. He got by with auctioning familt heirlooms to stay afloat. In his college years, he studied at the Kyoto Imperial University and became a main protege of the statesman Saionji Kinmochi. At the end of World War 1, he advocated for a seperate peace that better benefitted Japan. He criticised Western imperialism, stating that it threatened peace and prosperity across the world. In his college years he became associated with a group known as the House of Peers. This group kickstarted his political carreer and eventually set him on his way to becoming the Prim Minister of Japan. During his first tenure as PM, he oversaw the initial invasion of China in 1937. His time as PM was interrupted in between 1939 and 1940. His second term saw the routing of Chinese forces and the basic guarantee of victory in China. After the victory in China he went into political hiding away from the public eye but still maintained contact with the Emperor and various statesmen. In 1950, he was re-elected as PM and has been the Prime Minister ever since. His main duties include overseeing a massive empire and administrating unruly territories. He claims that this is his final term, leaving the fate of Japan to another lucky Prime Minister."
